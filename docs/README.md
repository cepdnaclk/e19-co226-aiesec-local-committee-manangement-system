## Introduction

AIESEC Local Committee Management System

## Problem

We noticed the following problems in current process which uses Google applications.

1. Data insecurity
2. Lengthy, repetitive processes
3. Not user friendly and have to use multiple tools to complete one task

## Solutions

1. Data insecurity - 
    a. Introducing user levels
    b. Restrictions on user levels to execute certain tasks - ex: Deleting records are only accessible for higher user levels

2. Lengthy, repetitive processes
    a. Automating repetitive processes - ex: Auto generating/sending emails once the necessary details have been filled.

3. Not user friendly and have to use multiple tools to complete one task
    a. Using user friendly UIs and create functionalities in such as way that, users can execute the tasks using only this system.

## Main functionalities of the system.

1. Member management
2. Member progress tracking
